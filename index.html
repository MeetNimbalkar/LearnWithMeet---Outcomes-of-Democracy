            <div class="question-text">How does democracy produce an accountable, responsive and legitimate government?</div>
            <div class="question-variant">Or "Democracies produce an accountable, responsive and legitimate governments." Support the statement with suitable examples.</div>
            <div class="question-variant">Or "Democracy is an accountable, responsible and legitimate government." Explain the statement.</div>
            <div class="exam-year">CBSE 2024</div>
            <div class="answer-label">Ans.</div>
            <div class="answer">Democracy produces an accountable, responsive and legitimate government in the following ways:</div>
            <div class="answer-subheading">Accountable Government</div>
            <div class="answer">Democracy produces an accountable government as the people have the right to choose their representatives through the electoral process. These elected representatives form the government and participate in the decision-making process on behalf of the people. This is known as transparency. If these elected representatives do not work in a proper way, people have a chance to not elect them in next election.</div>
            <div class="answer-subheading">Responsive Government</div>
            <div class="answer">Democracy produces a responsive government. As democratic government is elected by the people, it is people's own government. It promotes the formation of public opinion and take care of the needs and expectation of the people.</div>
            <div class="answer-subheading">Legitimate Government</div>
            <div class="answer">Further, democratic government is a legitimate government because regular election after a fixed time is its key feature. It may be slow, less efficient but it is the people's own legitimate government.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question-number">Q.2</div>
            <div class="question-text">What are the conditions under which democracies accommodate social diversities?</div>
            <div class="answer-label">Ans.</div>
            <div class="answer">Democracy is considered to be the most suitable form of government to accommodate these diversities as it aims at giving equal rights and opportunities to all the citizens irrespective of caste, religion, colour, sex, race, etc.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question-number">Q.3</div>
            <div class="question-text">Give arguments to support or oppose the following assertions.</div>
            <div class="question-variant">(a) Industrialised countries can afford democracy but the poor need dictatorship to become rich.</div>
            <div class="question-variant">(b) Democracy cannot reduce inequality of incomes between different citizens.</div>
            <div class="question-variant">(c) Government in poor countries should spend less on poverty reduction, health, education and spend more on industries and infrastructure.</div>
            <div class="question-variant">(d) In democracy, all citizens have one vote, which means that there is absence of any domination and conflict.</div>
            <div class="answer-label">Ans.</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>(a)</strong> This statement is incorrect. If we compare democracy and dictatorship regimes between 1950 to 2000, we find countries under dictatorship to be more economically advanced. But, if we compare between less developed countries, the difference is negligible. For example, India being a third world nation, now becomes one of the fast growing economies of the world. On the other hand, Zimbabwe which was a fairly prosperous nation, has run into huge international debt with the progression of Robert Mugabe's rule. Thus, it is not always proper to say that the poor need dictatorship to become rich.</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>(b)</strong> This statement is incorrect. Democracy reduces the inequality of incomes between citizens. For example, the Minimum Wages Act, enacted by the Indian Government have helped in increasing the per capita income of the country. Thereby, making its citizens more prosperous and reducing inequality in incomes of citizens.</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>(c)</strong> This statement is not correct as the government in poor countries should maintain a balance between investment on poverty, food, clothing, health, education and in industries and infrastructure. A country needs to spend on all the sectors maintaining a balance, so that every sector helps the other sector to grow.</div>
            <div class="answer"><strong>(d)</strong> This statement is not correct. In democracy, every citizen has one vote, political parties cannot avoid any social group. The political parties have to formulate policies which will benefit all the groups. But all these do not mean that conflicts are totally absent in a democracy. They can happen if the demands of one social group are against the demands of the other social group. Democracy only avoids the possibility of such conflicts by giving everyone equal rights and freedom in the society.</div>

        <div class="question-block">
            <div class="question-number">Q.4</div>

            <div class="answer">Democracy ensures that government officials are answerable to the people. Regular elections, transparency in governance, and right to information make the government accountable for its actions and decisions.</div>
            <div class="answer-subheading">2. Responsive Government</div>
            <div class="answer">Democratic governments respond to the needs and expectations of the people. Public opinion, media, and civil society organizations influence government policies and ensure that people's voices are heard.</div>
            <div class="answer-subheading">3. Legitimate Government</div>
            <div class="answer">Democracy provides legitimacy to the government through free and fair elections. People accept the government's authority because they have chosen it through their votes.</div>

            <div class="answer">Democracy enhances the dignity of citizens by providing them with fundamental rights, freedom of expression, and equal treatment before law regardless of their social background.</div>
